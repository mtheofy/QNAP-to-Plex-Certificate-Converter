# QNAP to Plex Certificate Converter

This script automates converting QNAP SSL certificates (`stunnel.pem` and `uca.pem`) into a PKCS#12 (`.p12`) bundle compatible with Plex Media Server. Script was tested on QTS 5.2.5 running Plex Media Server 1.41.7.

## Features
- Extracts private key and certificate from QNAP files
- Validates that the key and cert match
- Builds a full certificate chain including the CA
- Exports to PKCS#12 format with optional password
- Deploys the `.p12` file to Plexâ€™s certificate directory
- Restarts Plex service automatically (if available)
- Includes error handling and cleanup

## Usage

1. Update paths in the script such as $PLEX_DIR.
2. Run the script on your QNAP device with administrators permissions:
   ```bash
   ./update_plex_cert.sh
3. To setup the certificate in Plex.
   - Open the Plex Web App (i.e. in your browser go to http://mynas.myqnapcloud.com:32400)
   - Click on "Account Settings" then find Network under the name of your server (e.g. mynas)
   - Under Custom certificate location, set the path to $PLEX_DIR/plex.p12 (e.g. /share/CACHEDEV4_DATA/.qpkg/PlexMediaServer/Library/Plex Media Server/plex.p12)
   - Under Custom certificate domain, put the domain that your NAS' full domain (e.g. mynas.myqnapcloud.com). This is the domain name that was used for your certificate.
4. Stop and the start your Plex App in your QNAP.
5. Access the Plex Web App using https://mynas.myqnapcloud.com:32400 (note http<b>s</b>).

Check for the secure lock (or whatever your browser uses) that signifies a secure connection.
